    <h2>Who is Jacob Gain?</h2>

    <p>My name is Jacob Gain. I am a second generation Greek-Canadian. Some of my favourite things to do are go for
        walks, play basketball, and spend time with my friends. I played basketball a lot growing up, and it was always
        my favourite sport. I played through high school but stopped in University. I am currently attending Western
        Univeristy as a second year Software Engineering student. I got into software in my junior year of high school,
        when I took my first computer science class. I really enjoyed it and I knew that this was what I wanted to do in
        my future. I have a passion for coding and I will never not enjoy the feeling of success when a program
        successfully runs for the first time. I believe that this true enjoyment for this profession will lead me to
        excel more than others, because there are plenty of people just in it for the money.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Who does Jacob Gain want to become?</h2>
    <p>In my future, I want to be a successful software engineer for a company that values me as an asset and not just
        another employee number. I would prefer happiness over monetary success, and I want to make the people around me
        happy as well. I want to live up North with my future family, enjoying our time together and making memories. A
        short term goal that I have is to graduate from my program without being delayed by any academic reasons. I will
        pursure this using my strong work ethic and desire to learn.</p>
