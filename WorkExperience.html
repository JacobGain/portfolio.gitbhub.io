    <h2>Michelis Spray Foam Insulation Inc.</h2>
    <h5>Full-time summer job, May 2023-August 2023</h5>

    <p>In the summer after my first year of University, I started looking for a job. Through a mutual connection,
        I got set up at Michelis Spray Foam Insulation Inc. as a labourer. My role was small in the beginning, learning
        from my coworkers and helping others without much of my own responsibility. As the summer went on and I got the
        hang of everything, I took on more responsibility. I started driving the trucks and was able to
        go to jobs with just myself and the sprayer, as opposed to crews of 3 or 4. I learned a lot during my time at
        Michelis Spray Foam, including but not limited to the importance of punctuality, taking accountability, and
        working as a team.</p>

    <h2>Trevor Gain & Associates</h2>
    <h5>Part-time, January 2019-September 2022</h5>

    <p>My father, Trevor Gain, is an architect who owns his own business. During the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, all
        of southern Ontario's residents were stuck in their homes. This made homeowners realize that they wanted to
        reconstruct or renovate their homes. This meant my dad needed more help if he was to keep up with the increasing
        demand for his services. He employed my brother and I as administrative assistants to help with the smaller
        things, meaning he could continue working on the more important designs. We most often did his filing, prepared
        his projects for the
        Committee of Adjustment, and analyzed housing data. The most important lessons I took away from this job were
        maintaining organization and the importance of having required tasks done on time.</p>
